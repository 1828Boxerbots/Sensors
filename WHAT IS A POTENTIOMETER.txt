A potentiometer is a electronic device that you would hook up a servo or motor, or anything that will make the shaft it has move.
The potentiometer measuers how much something has turned. Unlike an encoder which measures the amount of rotations the motor has done
a potentiometer measures the ANGLE of which it has turned. 90 degrees, 20 degrees, 180 degrees, etc. This is a very broughd statment of
what a potentiometer is and you can find more info by looking it up online or looking through the files on this Github branch.
