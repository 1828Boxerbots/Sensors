oneywell’s MICRO SWITCH™ V7 miniature switches are designed for long term-reliability in a rugged switch packaged with a thermoplastic housing.
These switches may be installed in a wide range of applications from simple or precision on/off limits, presence/absence sensing, or embedded
in pressure or temperature assemblies. The V7 switch is available as a pin plunger style or with optional integral or auxiliary levers to
actuate the switch and offer versatility in the application. The switch requires as little as 0,15 Newtons [approximately 1⁄2 ounce] to operate
for extremely sensitive applications or an operating force of almost 4 Newtons [14 ounces] where higher forces are required. The V7 switch
can reliably control logic level electrical loads from less than 0.1 A to power duty switching up to 25 A.
Agency certifications for the MICRO SWITCH™ V7 switches are provided through CSA, ENEC, and UL for global use around the world.
