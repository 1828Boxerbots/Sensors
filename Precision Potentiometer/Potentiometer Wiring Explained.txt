"We connect three wires to the Arduino board. The first goes to ground from one of the outer pins of the potentiometer. The second 
goes from 5 volts to the other outer pin of the potentiometer. The third goes from analog input 2 to the middle pin of the potentiometer.

By turning the shaft of the potentiometer, we change the amount of resistence on either side of the wiper which is connected to the
center pin of the potentiometer. This changes the relative "closeness" of that pin to 5 volts and ground, giving us a different analog
input. When the shaft is turned all the way in one direction, there are 0 volts going to the pin, and we read 0. When the shaft is turned
all the way in the other direction, there are 5 volts going to the pin and we read 1023. In between, analogRead() returns a number 
between 0 and 1023 that is proportional to the amount of voltage being applied to the pin."
