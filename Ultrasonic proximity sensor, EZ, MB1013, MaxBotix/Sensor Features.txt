Continuously variable gain for control and side lobe suppression
Object detection to zero range objects
2.5 V to 5.5 V supply with 2 mA typical current draw
Readings can occur up to every 50 mS, (20 Hz rate)
Free run operation can continually measure and output range information
Triggered operation provides the range reading as desired
Interfaces are active simultaneously
