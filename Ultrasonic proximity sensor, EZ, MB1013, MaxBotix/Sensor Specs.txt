Resolution of 1‑mm
10Hz reading rate
Internal temperature compensation
Cost-effective solution where precision range-findings are needed
Sensor component allows users to lower the cost of their systems without sacrificing performance
42kHz Ultrasonic sensor measures distance to objects
RoHS compliant
Read from all sensor outputs: Analog Voltage, RS232 or TTL Serial, and Pulse Width
Virtually no sensor dead zone, objects closer than 30 cm will typically range as 30 cm
Maximum range of 5000 mm (195 inches)
Tolerates outside noise sources
Operates from 2.5V-5.5V
Low 3.1mA average current requirement
Small, light weight module
Designed for easy integration into your project or product
Operational Temperature from -0C to +65C (+32F to +149F)
Real-time automatic calibration (voltage, humidity, ambient noise)
Option external temperature compensation HR‑MaxTemp
Firmware filtering for better noise tolerance and clutter rejection
Great starting point for users unsure of which sensor to use
